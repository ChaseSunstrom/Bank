Camden Kirkpatrick - I created the Bank Account class and its sub-classes before the GitHub repo was created by Chase.

Chase Sunstrom - 9/12/2024
- Moved definition of bank account into a source file 
- Added header guards
- Removed "using namespace std" (bad practice)
- Added type aliases
- Changed exceptions to asserts (which cleaned up the code and is better practice)
- Changed member variables to use m_ (which is best practice)
- Cleaned up code
- Added  = default for default destructors and constructors
- Added everything to Bank namespace

Camden Kirkpatrick - 9/23/2024
- Added the Transaction class
- Removed the message in the Withdraw and Deposit methods in the BankAccount class
- The Display method in the Transaction class will display the info removed in the Withdraw and Deposit methods
- Removed the need to call the Withdraw and Deposit methods directly using Account objects
- The Withdraw and Deposit methods are called using an argument sent to the Transaction objects 

Camden Kirkpatrick - 9/24/2024
- Changed the Transaction constructor to use an initializer list
- Changed the BankAccount pointer member variable in the Transaction class to a BankAccount reference
- Changed the Transaction constructor to take a reference instead of a pointer
- Removed the '&' in front of the checking_accout object, when it's being sent as an argument in main.cpp
- Removed the assert in the Transaction constructor to check if the BankAccount pointer is null (changed to a reference)
- Removed the -> notation used in the Execute method, and changed to dot notation
- Changed the Execute method in the Transaction class to be private (only accessed by the constructor)

Chase Sunstrom - 10/14/2024
- Changed the Transaction and BankAccount classes to use enum classes as differentiating types
- Created the Bank class to manage and view bank accounts and transactions
